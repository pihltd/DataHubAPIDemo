    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook walks through the basics of using the Data Submission Portal API to work on, validate, and submit your data.  These APIs are designed to allow users to perform all the actions that can be done via the [Data Submission Portal](https://hub.datacommons.cancer.gov/) from a notebook or script.  The intent is to allow submitters to operate directly from their own environments if they so choose rathar than work through the graphical submission interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few prerequists that you have to meet before you can use this API:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='prerequisites'></a>\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "## GraphQL\n",
    "The Data Submission Portal API uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and a good understanding of how to use GraphQL is required.  Since GraphQL can be complex, a tutorial is beyond the scope of this document, however the [GraphQL Documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/) can be very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Login.gov account\n",
    "Use of the Data Submission Portal in general requires that a user have an account registered with [Login.gov](https://www.login.gov/) (NIH users can use their NIH account and PIV card).  Note that a Login.gov account is distinct from an eRA Commons identity that is frequently used at NIH.  They are not the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approved Submission\n",
    "You must recieve approval to submit data to CRDC prior to using the Data Submission Portal APIs.  If you need approval, please read and follow the [Submissions Request Instructions](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/submit).  Instructions for using the graphical data submission process are on the same page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An API Token\n",
    "If you are an approved submitter with a Login.gov or NIH account, you can generate an API token from the graphical interface.  Log into the system, then click on your user name and select the **API Token** menu option.  This will bring up a dialog box that allows you to create an API token and copy it to your clipboard.  There are two things to note about API tokens\n",
    "- The token is tied to your user identity and can be used on any submission that you're approved to work on.\n",
    "- You can have only one token at a time.  Generating a new token will revoke the previous token.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Submit** : Once all of the validation errors have been corrected and the validation results are either completely clean or only have warnings, the study is ready to be submitted.  Sending a submit request will hand over control of the files and data to the CRDC Data Team for final checks.  Note that once you submit a submission, no further edits are allowed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Cancel** : If you want to abandon a submission *that has not been submitted to CRDC yet*, sending a cancellation request will lock the submission and withdraw it from the system.  **Further work is not allowed on cancelled submissions so be sure that you want to cancel before you issue this query.**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Withdraw** : Withdraw is similar to cancel only it is used on submissions that have already been submitted to CRDC.  So if you find that a study was submitted before everythign was complete, or if other errors are found that necessitate stopping the submission process, sending a **Withdraw** query will prevent the release of the submitted data to the data commons and return the submission to it's previous, unsubmitted, state.\n",

There are more queries and mutations that are available to provide additional information and capabilties for integrating with your systems and we suggest reading the API documentation for further details.  And while this example is in Python, any language that can use GraphQL queries is suitable for interaction with this API.\n",
